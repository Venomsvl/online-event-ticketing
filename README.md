# Online Event Ticketing System

## What the Project Does
An online event ticketing system is a full-stack web application designed to allow users to browse, search, and purchase tickets for various events—such as concerts, sports games, and theater shows—while providing organizers with the ability to post and manage their own events. System administrators have full control over user and event data.

## Why the Project Is Useful
- Centralizes event listings and ticket purchasing in one platform.  
- Streamlines the process for users to find and book events.  
- Empowers organizers to create, update, or remove events effortlessly.  
- Ensures admins can manage the platform’s overall operations and maintain data integrity.
